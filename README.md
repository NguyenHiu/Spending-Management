# Spending-Management

## About The Project
Spending management is very important to our lives, it helps us to always be ready for anything that will happen. For example, if your car breaks down, you need a lot of money to fix it, but it's okay because managing your monthly expenses will help you save some money.

**Purpose:** The application runs on a __**BLOCKCHAIN**__ database, we are studying blockchain, so this project helps us to understand more broadly about bitcoin/blockchain mechanism. App uses __Socket__ to send or receive messages, it's optional.

## Release Folder 
There are 2 files in _the release folder_, 
1. **run.exe** creates a Hub which every node joins to the network must be connected with, Hub will provide _Ip, Port, Public Key, and Private Key_ for the node. So we need to run _run.exe_ first.
2. **user.exe** creates a new user, represents a user which joins the network and contains a node object.
